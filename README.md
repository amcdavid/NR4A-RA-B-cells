# Dynamic spectrum of ectopic lymphoid B cell activation in the RA synovium characterized by NR4A nuclear receptor expression

Preprint is [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.14.443150v2)

synovium_sc: code and primary data for expression and BCR for single cells from peripheral blood and synovium from RA134, RA172, RA195, RA221, e.g. figure 1A-1D, 2A-2D

reanalysis: code to infer cell types, e.g. figure 1E

amp_bulk: differential expression of NR4A in low-input bulk data, e.g. figure 1F.

Some data to run this scripts may need to be downloaded from IMMPort [1](https://www.immport.org/shared/study/SDY998), [2](https://www.immport.org/shared/study/SDY1299) and/or GEO, since we did not have permission to directly (re)-share.
